## Description

**Tired of going through all images in a folder and comparing them manually to check if they are duplicates?**

:white_check_mark: The difPy Web App **automates** this task for you!

Upload **up to 200 images** and let difPy compare them for you. After the comparison is done, difPy lets you **download a ZIP file of the deduplicated images**.

</p>

difPy does not compare images based on their hashes. It compares them based on their tensors i. e. the image content - this allows difPy to **not only search for duplicate images, but also for similar images**.
