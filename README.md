## Description
The difPy Web App is based on difPy, a Python-based package that automates the search for duplicate/similar images.

difPy does not compare images based on their hashes. It compares them based on their tensors i. e. the image content - this allows difPy to **not only search for duplicate images, but also for similar images**.
